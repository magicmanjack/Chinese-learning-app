TODO:
    We got the database side working. Now need to get webserver side working. Display database data in index.php.

    Get interface to upload to database.
    Get user profiles working.

Rules:
    Needs to operate on at least 3 different machines.
    One of which should be responsible for data storage.
    
Lets use vagrant.

Ideas:

Chinese Learning tool:
    Provides a simple and fun method for chinese practice.
    
    Bare bones basic program which can be iterated
    on later for my chinese portfolio.

    Base program:

        Can create user profile.

        User can add characters they want to learn. Or add from a selection of lessons in the NPCR textbook.
        Then add pinyin. <<<<  https://pinyin.js.org/en-US
        Then add definition.
        Add rememberence prompt (a memnonic which helps them remember.) Pops up
        if they choose.

        Upon play:
            Goes through each word randomly in the set.
            For each word it either shows either:
                pinyin. The player has to choose out of a set of random characters.
                hanzi. The player has to either type pinyin or english meaning.
                english word. The player has to input the chinese character.
            Records time.

    Future:
        https://talkify.net/#tryme for TTS. 1000 free requests per month. Need to get an API key.
